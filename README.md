This project is a front-end design for a simple E-Learning Platform built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes three main pages:
	1.	Index Page – A clean homepage displaying featured courses and categories.
	2.	Course Page – Lists all available courses with images, descriptions, and embedded videos.
	3.	Progress Page – Shows user progress using interactive progress bars and simple tracking elements.

The design is fully responsive and styled for a modern learning experience. JavaScript is used for interactivity such as dynamic progress updates and content toggling. This front-end layout provides the structure for a complete e-learning platform and can be integrated with a backend system in the future.
